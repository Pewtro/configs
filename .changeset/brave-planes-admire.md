'@putstack/eslint-config-typescript': major
---

First release of `@putstack/eslint-config-typescript` that provides sensible, but strict, defaults for new and existing projects.
If the default is too strict, there is also a `@putstack/eslint-config-typescript/base` that is less strict that you can start out with.
