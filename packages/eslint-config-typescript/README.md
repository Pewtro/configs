# An ESLint configuration by Putro

This ESLint setup should let any new (or existing) projects adhere to best practices within TypeScript and write fewer bugs as a result!
The default version is quite strict, so an existing project might opt for using the base version, see more under [Usage](#Usage).

## Installation

To install this package run the following command in the terminal in the root directory of your application.

```
npm install --save-dev @putstack/eslint-config-typescript
```

**OR**

```
yarn add -D @putstack/eslint-config-typescript
```

## Usage

Ensure that your ESLint configuration is setup to utilize TypeScript's type checking API by following this [guide]().

Add this to your config by editing your .eslintrc.cjs or equivalent.

```
{
    extends: ['@putstack/typescript'],
}
```

If the default is too strict on an existing project, you can also use the `base`to exclude some of the more strict rules.
To see what is dincluded in which package, please view [this section](#eslint-plugins-and-configurations).

```
{
    extends: ['@putstack/typescript/base']
}
```

## Example

This project uses the configuration on itself, as seen in the root .eslintrc.cjs file.
