# ESLint config for typescript changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- c59e5c9: First release of `@putstack/eslint-config-typescript` that provides sensible, but strict, defaults for new and existing projects.
  If the default is too strict, there is also a `@putstack/eslint-config-typescript/base` that is less strict that you can start out with.
